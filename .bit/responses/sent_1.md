## Part 1: Sentence Analyzer - Letter Counter
In the follow 3 steps, you will create a program that analyzes a sentence (how cool is that 😎)

### 🔨 Function Specs:
**Function name:** `letter_counter()`

Create a function that takes in `sentence` as a parameter and returns how many letters there are in that entire sentence.
> Punctuation (.,!#$%..etc) don't count as letters. Only alphanumeric characters count!


### 📝 Test your work:
⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Bit Project is the best!", the function should return `19`
⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Good luck on your application", the function should return `25`

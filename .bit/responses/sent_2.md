Only two more steps, you got this!

### 🔨 Function Specs:
**Function name:** `word_counter()`

Create a function that takes in `sentence` as a parameter and returns how many words.
> Punctuation does not count as words. 


### 📝 Test your work:
⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Bit Project is the best!", the function should return `5`
⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Good luck on your application", the function should return `5`

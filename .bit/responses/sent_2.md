## Part 2: Sentence Analyzer - Word Counter
1. Create a new branch from `main` named `word`. 
2. Create a function named `word_counter` that takes in  a `sentence` string as a parameter and returns how many words.
3. Once the function is created, export it at the bottom of your file: `exports.word_counter = word_counter` (so we can test your code!)
4. Commit your code to the `word` branch. 
5. Create a pull request to merge the `word` branch onto `main`, and only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes. 

> ❗ for this step, edit the `word_counter.js` file

### 🔨 Function Specs:
**Function name:** `word_counter()`

Create a function named `word_counter` that takes in `sentence` as a parameter and returns how many words.
> Punctuation does not count as words. 


### 📝 Test your work:
⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Bit Project is the best!", the function should return `5`

⭐ if the `sentence` parameter is "Good luck on your application", the function should return `5`

## Part 3: Sentence Analyzer - Specific Letter Counter
Oooh, this step is a little bit harder! Don't worry if you can't finish this step entirely, do the best you can :)

### 🔨 Function Specs:
**Function name:** `spec_letter_counter()`

Create a function that takes in `sentence` as a parameter and returns a JSON object with the count of each letter.
> Punctuation does not count as letters. 

> Letters with no occurances in the sentence should NOT to be included in the JSON object. 

> Uppercase and lowercase are NOT the same character!

Example Output:
```json=
{
    "a": 12,
    "d": 1,
    "r": 2
}
```
